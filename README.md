## Abstract
This study investigates how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and anthropogenic aerosols (AAER) influence the characteristics of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Observational SST data from NOAA’s ERSSTv5 are combined with CESM2 Single-Forcing Large Ensemble experiments (LENS2, GHG2, AAER2) to classify ENSO events and construct DJF composites across multiple historical windows.  

ENSO classification is based on the **r–θ framework** for event identification, building on the parameterization approaches of **Zhiyuan et al. (2019)** and **Ham et al. (2019)**. This method applies percentile-based thresholds to distinguish El Niño and La Niña phases, enabling a consistent comparison between observations and model ensembles.  

For each CESM2 experiment, **at least 10 ensemble member simulations** were utilized to ensure robust statistics and capture internal variability. Composite SST anomalies are generated by averaging event years relative to climatology, with CESM2 POP grid outputs regridded to the observational 1°×1° grid using xESMF or scipy.griddata. Ensemble-mean composites are then compared across experiments to assess changes in ENSO frequency, amplitude, and spatial structure under different forcing scenarios.  

This work draws on **Simpson et al. (2023)** for context on CESM2 single-forcing ensemble design and ENSO diagnostics in the Pacific, and **Leupold et al. (2023)** for composite-based approaches to internal SST variability. Together, these references provide a foundation for understanding how external forcings reshape ENSO dynamics.

## Outline
1. **Data Sources**
   - Observational SSTs: NOAA ERSSTv5  
   - Model Data: CESM2 Single-Forcing Large Ensemble (LENS2, GHG2, AAER2)  
   - At least 10 ensemble members per CESM2 experiment  

2. **Methodology**
   - ENSO classification using r–θ framework (Zhiyuan et al. 2019; Ham et al. 2019)  
   - Percentile-based thresholding (top 60% r values)  
   - Seasonal DJF composites relative to climatology  
   - Regridding CESM2 POP outputs to observational grid  

3. **Analysis**
   - ENSO type frequencies across scenarios (GHG2, AAER2, LENS2, Observations)  
   - Normalized vs. unnormalized frequency comparisons  
   - Divergence metrics (KL, Jensen–Shannon) between models and observations  
   - Composite SST anomaly maps across historical windows  

4. **Objective**
   - Quantify the impacts of GHG emissions and anthropogenic aerosols on ENSO characteristics  
   - Assess changes in ENSO frequency, amplitude, and spatial structure under different forcing scenarios
